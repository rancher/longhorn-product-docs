== Prerequisites for Access and Authentication

These instructions assume that Longhorn is installed.

If you installed Longhorn YAML manifest, you'll need to set up an Ingress controller to allow external traffic into the cluster, and authentication will not be enabled by default. This applies to Helm and kubectl installations. For information on creating an NGINX Ingress controller with basic authentication, refer to link:./longhorn-ingress[this section.]

If Longhorn was installed as a Rancher catalog app, Rancher automatically created an Ingress controller for you with access control (the rancher-proxy).
