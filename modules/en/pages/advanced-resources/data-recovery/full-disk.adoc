= Recovering from a Full Disk
:weight: 4
:current-version: {page-component-version}

If one disk used by one of the Longhorn replicas is full, that replica will go to the error state, and Longhorn will rebuild another replica on another node/disk.

To recover from a full disk,

. Disable the scheduling for the full disk.
+
Longhorn should have already marked the disk as `unschedulable`.
+
This step is to make sure the disk will not be scheduled to by accident after more space is freed up.

. Identify the replicas in the error state on the disk using the Longhorn UI's disk page.
. Remove the replicas in the error state.

== Recommended after Recovery

We recommend adding more disks or more space to the node that had this situation.
