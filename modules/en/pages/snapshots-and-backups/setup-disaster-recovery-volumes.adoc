A *disaster recovery (DR) volume* is a special volume that is mainly intended to store data in a backup cluster in case the whole main cluster goes down. Disaster recovery volumes are used to increase the resiliency of Longhorn volumes.

For a longer explanation of how DR volumes work, see the xref:concepts.adoc#_3_3_disaster_recovery_volumes[concepts section.]

For disaster recovery volume, `Last Backup` indicates the most recent backup of its original backup volume.

If the icon representing the disaster volume is gray, it means the volume is restoring the `Last Backup` and this volume cannot be activated. If the icon is blue, it means the volume has restored the `Last Backup`.

== Creating DR Volumes

____
*Prerequisites:* Set up two Kubernetes clusters. These will be called cluster A and cluster B. Install Longhorn on both clusters, and set the same backup target on both clusters. For help setting the backup target, refer to xref:snapshots-and-backups/backup-and-restore/set-backup-target.adoc[this page.]
____

. In the cluster A, make sure the original volume X has a backup created or has recurring backups scheduled.
. In backup page of cluster B, choose the backup volume X, then create disaster recovery volume Y. It's highly recommended to use the backup volume name as the disaster volume name.
. Longhorn will automatically attach the DR volume Y to a random node. Then Longhorn will start polling for the last backup of volume X, and incrementally restore it to the volume Y.

[#activating]
== Activating DR Volumes

Longhorn supports activating a disaster recovery (DR) volume under the following conditions:

* The volume is healthy, indicating that all replicas are in a healthy state.
* When the global setting xref:references/settings.adoc#_allow_volume_creation_with_degraded_availability[`Allow Volume Creation with Degraded Availability`] is enabled, the volume is degraded, indicating some replicas are unhealthy.

When the setting `Allow Volume Creation with Degraded Availability` is disabled, attempting to activate a degraded DR volume will cause the volume to become stuck in the attached state. However, after enabling the setting, the DR volume will be activated and converted into a normal volume, remaining in the detached state.
