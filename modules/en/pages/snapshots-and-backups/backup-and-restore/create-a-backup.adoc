Backups in Longhorn are objects in an off-cluster backupstore. A backup of a snapshot is copied to the backupstore, and the endpoint to access the backupstore is the backup target. For more information, see xref:concepts.adoc#_3_1_how_backups_work[this section.]

*Prerequisite:* A backup target must be set up. For more information, see xref:snapshots-and-backups/backup-and-restore/set-backup-target.adoc[Set the BackupTarget]. If the BackupTarget has not been set, you'll be presented with an error.
