:current-version: {page-component-version}

Longhorn supports https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volume-pvc-datasource/[CSI volume cloning].
Suppose that you have the following `source-pvc`:

[subs="+attributes",yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: source-pvc
spec:
  storageClassName: longhorn
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 10Gi
----

You can create a new PVC that has the exact same content as the `source-pvc` by applying the following yaml file:

[subs="+attributes",yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: cloned-pvc
spec:
  storageClassName: longhorn
  dataSource:
    name: source-pvc
    kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 10Gi
----

____
Note:
In addition to the requirements listed at https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volume-pvc-datasource/[CSI volume cloning],
the `cloned-pvc` must have the same `resources.requests.storage` as the `source-pvc`.
