= Install Longhorn Using Rancher
:description: Run Longhorn on Kubernetes with Rancher 2.x
:current-version: {page-component-version}

One benefit of installing Longhorn through Rancher Apps & Marketplace is that Rancher provides authentication to the Longhorn UI.

If there is a new version of Longhorn available, you will see an `Upgrade Available` sign on the `Apps & Marketplace` screen. You can click `Upgrade` button to upgrade Longhorn manager. See more about upgrade xref:../../upgrades/upgrades.adoc[here].

== Prerequisites

Each node in the Kubernetes cluster where Longhorn is installed must fulfill xref:../../installation-setup/requirements.adoc[these requirements.]

https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/blob/v{current-version}/scripts/environment_check.sh[This script] can be used to check the Longhorn environment for potential issues.

== Installation

____
*Note*:

* For Kubernetes < v1.25, if your cluster still enables Pod Security Policy admission controller, set `Other Settings > Pod Security Policy` to `true` to install `longhorn-psp` PodSecurityPolicy resource which allows privileged Longhorn pods to start.
____

. Optional: If Rancher version is 2.5.9 or before, we recommend creating a new project for Longhorn, for example, `Storage`.
