:current-version: {page-component-version}

== System Backup Bundle

Longhorn system backup creates a resource bundle and uploads it to the remote backup target.

It includes below resources associating with the Longhorn system:

* BackingImages
* ClusterRoles
* ClusterRoleBindings
* ConfigMaps
* CustomResourceDefinitions
* DaemonSets
* Deployments
* EngineImages
* PersistentVolumes
* PersistentVolumeClaims
* RecurringJobs
* Roles
* RoleBindings
* Settings
* Services
* ServiceAccounts
* StorageClasses
* Volumes

[NOTE]
====
* The default backup target (`default`) is always used to store system backups.
* The Longhorn system backup bundle only includes resources operated by Longhorn.
* Longhorn does not back up the `Nodes` resource. The Longhorn Manager on the target cluster is responsible for creating its own Longhorn `Node` custom resources.
* Longhorn is unable to back up V2 Data Engine backing images.

== Create a System Backup

You can create a Longhorn system backup using the Longhorn UI. Or with the `kubectl` command.

=== Prerequisites

* xref:snapshots-backups/volume-snapshots-backups/configure-backup-target.adoc[]. Longhorn saves the system backups to the remote backup store. You will see an error during creation when the backup target is unset.
+
NOTE: Unsetting the backup target clears the existing `SystemBackup` custom resource. Longhorn syncs to the remote backup store after setting the backup target. Another cluster can also sync to the same list of system backups when the backup target is the same.

* Create a backup for all volumes (optional).
+
NOTE: Longhorn system restores volume with the latest backup. We recommend updating the last backup for all volumes. By taking volume backups, you ensure that the data is up-to-date with the system backup. For more information, please refer to the <<_volume_backup_policy,Configuration - Volume Backup Policy>> section.

=== Configuration

==== Volume Backup Policy

The Longhorn system backup offers the following volume backup policy options:

* `if-not-present`: Longhorn creates a backup for volumes that either lack an existing backup or have an outdated latest backup.
* `always`: Longhorn creates a backup for all volumes, regardless of their existing backups.
* `disabled`: Longhorn does not create any backups for volumes.

=== Single Execution

==== Create a System Backup Using the {longhorn-product-name} UI

. Go to the `System Backup` page in the `Setting` drop-down list.
. Click `Create` under `System Backup`.
. Give a `Name` for the system backup.
. Select a `Volume Backup Policy` for the system backup.
. The system backup will be ready to use when the state changes to `Ready`.

==== Create a System Backup Using `kubectl`

. Execute `kubectl create` to create a {longhorn-product-name} `SystemBackup` custom resource.
+
[subs="+attributes",yaml]
----
apiVersion: longhorn.io/v1beta2
kind: SystemBackup
metadata:
  name: demo
  namespace: longhorn-system
spec:
  volumeBackupPolicy: if-not-present
----

. The system backup will be ready to use when the state changes to `Ready`.

=== Recurring Job

==== Create a Recurring Backup Job Using the UI

. Go to the *Recurring Job* page.

. Click *Create Recurring Job*.

. Configure the following settings:
+
* *Name*: Specify a name for the recurring job.
* *Task*: Select *System Backup*.
* *Retain*: Specify the number of system backups that {longhorn-product-name} must retain.
* *Cron*: Specify the cron expression (a string consisting of fields separated by whitespace characters) that defines the schedule properties.
* *Parameters*: Select *volume-backup-policy*.

. Click *OK*.

{longhorn-product-name} creates system backups according to the schedule defined in the *Cron* field.

==== Create a Recurring Backup Job Using `kubectl`

Run `kubectl create` to create a {longhorn-product-name} `RecurringJob` custom resource with the task `system-backup`.

Example:

[,yaml]
----
apiVersion: longhorn.io/v1beta2
kind: RecurringJob
metadata:
  name: demo
  namespace: longhorn-system
spec:
  task: system-backup
  cron: '* * * * *'
  retain: 1
  parameters:
    volume-backup-policy: if-not-present
----

{longhorn-product-name} creates system backup according to the schedule defined in the `cron` field.

== Delete System Backups

You can delete the Longhorn system backup in the remote backup target using the Longhorn UI. Or with the `kubectl` command.

=== Delete a System Backup Using the Longhorn UI

. Go to the `System Backup` page in the `Setting` drop-down list.
. Delete a single system backup in the `Operation` drop-down menu next to the system backup. Or delete in batch with the `Delete` button.
+
NOTE: Deleting the system backup will also make a deletion in the backup store.

=== Delete a System Backup Using `kubectl`

. Execute `kubectl delete` to delete a Longhorn `SystemBackup` custom resource.
+
----
> kubectl -n longhorn-system get systembackup
NAME   VERSION   STATE   CREATED
demo   v1.4.0    Ready   2022-11-24T04:23:24Z

> kubectl -n longhorn-system delete systembackup/demo
systembackup.longhorn.io "demo" deleted
