{longhorn-product-name} natively supports backing images.

A QCOW2 or RAW image can be set as the backing/base image of a {longhorn-product-name} volume, which allows {longhorn-product-name} to be integrated with a virtualization solution such as https://www.suse.com/products/rancher/virtualization[{harvester-product-name}].

[IMPORTANT]
====
The image size must be *a multiple of 512 bytes*. {longhorn-product-name} uses direct I/O, which requires alignment of file sizes with the underlying storage block size.

== Create a V1 Data Engine Backing Image

=== Parameters

==== Data Source

You can prepare a V1 backing image using any of the supported data sources.

. Download a backing image file (using a URL).
. Upload a file from your local machine. This option is available to {longhorn-product-name} UI users.
. Export an existing in-cluster volume as a backing image.
. Restore a backing image from the backupstore, For more information, see xref:snapshots-backups/backing-image-backups.adoc[Backing Image Backup].
. Clone a backing image.

==== Volume exporting

A backing image serves as the initial snapshot in the snapshot chain of a {longhorn-product-name} volume. When you export a volume with an associated backing image, {longhorn-product-name} merges that image with the delta changes, resulting in a new consolidated backing image.

==== Checksum

* The checksum of a backing image is *the SHA512 checksum* of the whole backing image *file* rather than that of the actual content.
What's the difference? When {longhorn-product-name} calculates the checksum of a qcow2 file, it will read the file as a raw file instead of using the qcow library to read the correct content. In other words, users always get the correct checksum by executing `shasum -a 512 <the file path>` regardless of the file format.
* It's recommended to provide the expected checksum during backing image creation.
Otherwise, {longhorn-product-name} will consider the checksum of the first file as the correct one. Once there is something wrong with the first file preparation, which then leads to an incorrect checksum as the expected value, this backing image is probably unavailable.

==== Scheduling

* {longhorn-product-name} first prepares and stores the backing image file on a random node and disk, and then duplicates the file to the disks that are storing the replicas.
* For improved space efficiency, you can add `nodeSelector` and `diskSelector` to force storing of backing image files on a specific set of nodes and disks.
* The replicas cannot be scheduled on nodes or disks where the backing image cannot be scheduled.

==== Number of Copies

* You can add `minNumberOfCopies` to ensure that multiple backing image files exist in the cluster.
* You can adjust the `minNumberOfCopies` in the global setting to apply the default value to the BackingImage.

=== Methods of Creating a Backing Image

==== Create a Backing Image Using the {longhorn-product-name} UI

On menu:Advanced[Backing Images] page, users can create backing images with any kinds of data source.

==== Create a V1 Backing Image Using YAML

You can download a file or export an existing volume as a backing image via YAML.
It's better not to "upload" a file via YAML. Otherwise, you need to manually handle the data upload via HTTP requests.

Here are some examples:

[subs="+attributes",yaml]
----
apiVersion: longhorn.io/v1beta2
kind: BackingImage
metadata:
  name: bi-download
  namespace: longhorn-system
spec:
  dataEngine: v1

==== Create a Backing Image Using a StorageClass and PVC

. In a Longhorn StorageClass.
. Setting parameter `backingImageName` means asking {longhorn-product-name} to use this backing image during volume creation.
. If you want to create the backing image, as long as it does not exist during the CSI volume creation, parameters `backingImageDataSourceType` and `backingImageDataSourceParameters` should be set. Similarly to YAML, it's better not to create a backing image via "upload" in StorageClass. Note that if all of these parameters are set and the backing image already exists, {longhorn-product-name} will validate if the parameters match the existing one before using it.

 ** For `download`:
+
[subs="+attributes",yaml]
----
kind: StorageClass
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: longhorn-backing-image-example
provisioner: driver.longhorn.io
allowVolumeExpansion: true
reclaimPolicy: Delete
volumeBindingMode: Immediate
parameters:
  numberOfReplicas: "3"
  staleReplicaTimeout: "2880"
  backingImage: "bi-download"
  backingImageDataSourceType: "download"
  backingImageDataSourceParameters: '{"url": "https://backing-image-example.s3-region.amazonaws.com/test-backing-image"}'
  backingImageChecksum: "SHA512 checksum of the backing image"
  backingImageMinNumberOfCopies: "2"
  backingImageNodeSelector: "node1"
  backingImageDiskSelector: "disk1"
  dataEngine: "v1"
----

 ** For `export-from-volume`:
+
[subs="+attributes",yaml]
----
kind: StorageClass
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: longhorn-backing-image-example
provisioner: driver.longhorn.io
allowVolumeExpansion: true
reclaimPolicy: Delete
volumeBindingMode: Immediate
parameters:
  numberOfReplicas: "3"
  staleReplicaTimeout: "2880"
  backingImage: "bi-export-from-volume"
  backingImageDataSourceType: "export-from-volume"
  backingImageDataSourceParameters: '{"volume-name": "vol-export-src", "export-type": "qcow2"}'
  backingImageMinNumberOfCopies: "2"
  backingImageNodeSelector: "node1"
  backingImageDiskSelector: "disk1"
  dataEngine: "v1"
----
. Create a PVC with the StorageClass. Then the backing image will be created (with the {longhorn-product-name} volume) if it does not exist.
. {longhorn-product-name} starts to prepare the backing images to disks for the replicas when a volume using the backing image is attached to a node.

[NOTE]
====
* Please be careful of the escape character `\` when you input a download URL in a StorageClass.
* A backing image that is created using a StorageClass has the same data engine as the volume.
====

== Use a Backing Image in a Volume

Users can <<Create a Backing Image Using a StorageClass and PVC, directly create then immediately use a backing image via StorageClass>> or utilize an existing backing image as mentioned below.

[discrete]
==== Use an Existing Backing Image

[discrete]
===== Use an Existing Backing Image During Volume Creation

. Click menu:Advanced[Backing Images] in the {longhorn-product-name} UI.
. Click *Create Backing Image* to create a backing image with a unique name and a valid URL.
. Select a backing image from the list. The volume and the backing image must use the same data engine.
. {longhorn-product-name} starts to download the backing image to disks for the replicas when a volume using the backing image is attached to a node.

[discrete]
===== Use an Existing Backing Image During Volume Restoration

. Click `Backup` and pick up a backup volume for the restore.
. As long as the backing image is already set for the backup volume, {longhorn-product-name} will automatically choose the backing image during the restore.
. {longhorn-product-name} allows you to re-specify or override the backing image during the restore.

[discrete]
==== Download a Backing Image File

Since v1.3.0, users can download existing backing image files to the local machine via UI.

[NOTE]
====
* Users need to make sure the backing image existence when they use UI to create or restore a volume with a backing image specified.
* Before downloading an existing backing image file to the local, users need to guarantee there is a ready file for it.
* Downloading of V2 Data Engine backing images is currently not supported.
====

== Create a V2 Data Engine Backing Image

Starting v1.8.0, you can create a backing image that is supported by the V2 Data Engine by configuring `Data Engine` in the YAML (through the UI or a StorageClass).

=== Parameters

All parameters are the same as that of the V1 Data Engine backing image, except for `Data Engine`.

==== Data Sources

You can prepare a V2 Data Engine backing image using any of the supported data sources.

* Download a backing image file (using a URL).
* Upload a file from your local machine. This option is available to {longhorn-product-name} UI users.
* Export an existing in-cluster V1 Data Engine volume as a backing image.
* Restore a backing image from the backupstore. For more information, see xref:snapshots-backups/backing-image-backups.adoc[Backing Image Backup].
* Clone a V1 backing image.

[NOTE]
====
* The following operations are currently not supported:
 ** Exporting from a V2 Data Engine volume
 ** Cloning a V2 backing image
 ** Backing up a V2 backing image
* Unlike the V1 Data Engine, which is file-based, the V2 Data Engine requires {longhorn-product-name} to store the backing image data in an SPDK logical volume. As a result, for qcow2 images, {longhorn-product-name} must first convert the qcow2 image to a raw format before storing the data to the V2 Data Engine backing image, enabling it to read the correct data.
====

== Clean Up Backing Images

[discrete]
==== Clean Up Backing Images in Disks

* {longhorn-product-name} automatically cleans up the unused backing image files on the disks based on xref:longhorn-system/settings.adoc#_backing_image_cleanup_wait_interval[the setting `Backing Image Cleanup Wait Interval`]. But {longhorn-product-name} will retain at least one file on a disk for each backing image.
* You can manually remove backing images from disks using the {longhorn-product-name} UI. Go to *Setting* > *Backing Image*, and then click the name of a specific backing image. In the window that opens, select one or more disks and then click *Clean Up*.
* Once there is one replica in a disk using a backing image, no matter what the replica's current state is, the backing image file in this disk cannot be cleaned up.

[discrete]
==== Delete Backing Images

* The backing image can be deleted only when there is no volume using it.

== Backing Image Recovery

* If there is still a ready backing image file on one disk, {longhorn-product-name} will automatically clean up the failed backing image files, then re-launch these files from the ready one.
* If somehow all files of a backing image become failed, and the first file is :
 ** downloaded from a URL, {longhorn-product-name} will restart the downloading.
 ** exported from an existing volume, {longhorn-product-name} will (attach the volume if necessary then) restart the export.
 ** uploaded from user local env, there is no way to recover it. Users need to delete this backing image then re-create a new one by re-uploading the file.
* When a node is down or the backing image manager pod on the node is unavailable, all backing image files on the node will become `unknown`. Later, if the node is back and the pod is running, {longhorn-product-name} will detect that and then reuse the existing files automatically.

== Backing Image Eviction

* You can manually evict all backing image files from a node or disk by setting `Scheduling` to `Disabled` and `Eviction Requested` to `True` on the {longhorn-product-name} UI.
* If only one backing image file exists in the cluster, {longhorn-product-name} first duplicates the file to another disk and then deletes the file.
* If the backing image file cannot be duplicated to other disks, {longhorn-product-name} does not delete the file. You can update the settings to resolve the issue.

== Backing Image Workflow

. To manage all backing image files on a disk, {longhorn-product-name} creates a single backing image manager pod for each disk. Once the disk has no backing image file requirement, the backing image manager is removed automatically.
. Once a backing image file is prepared by the backing image manager for a disk, the file will be shared among all volume replicas in this disk.
. When a backing image is created, {longhorn-product-name} launches a backing image data source pod to prepare the initial file. The file data comes from a source specified by the user—such as a download from a remote location, an upload from a local file, or an export from an existing volume. Once preparation is done, the backing image manager pod on the same disk takes over the file, and {longhorn-product-name} stops the data source pod.
. Once a new backing image is used by a volume, the backing image manager pods in the disks that the volume replicas reside on will be asked to sync the file from the backing image manager pods that already contain the file.
. As mentioned in the section <<_clean_up_backing_images_in_disks,#clean_up_backing_images_in_disks>>, the file will be cleaned up automatically if all replicas in one disk do not use one backing image file.

== Concurrent Limit of Backing Image Syncing

* `Concurrent Backing Image Replenish Per Node Limit` in the global settings controls how many backing images copies on a node can be replenished simultaneously.
* When set to 0, {longhorn-product-name} does not automatically replenish the copy, even if it is below the minNumberOfCopies.

== Warning

* The download URL of the backing image should be public. We will improve this part in the future.
* If there is high memory usage of one backing image manager pod after <<_download_the_backing_image_file_to_the_local_machine,file download>>, this is caused by the system cache/buffer. The memory usage will decrease automatically hence you don't need to worry about it. See https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/4055[the GitHub ticket] for more details.
