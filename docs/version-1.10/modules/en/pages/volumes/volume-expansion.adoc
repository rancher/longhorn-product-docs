Volumes are expanded in two stages. First, Longhorn resizes the block device, then it expands the filesystem.

Longhorn supports online expansion. Most of the time Longhorn can directly expand an attached volumes without limitations, no matter if the volume is being R/W or rebuilding.

If the volume was not expanded though the CSI interface (e.g. for Kubernetes older than v1.16), the capacity of the corresponding PVC and PV won't change.

== Prerequisites

* For offline expansion, the Longhorn version must be v0.8.0 or later.
* For online expansion, the Longhorn version must be v1.4.0 or later.

== Expand a Longhorn volume

There are two ways to expand a Longhorn volume: with a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) and with the Longhorn UI.

[discrete]
==== Via PVC

This method is applied only if:

* The PVC is dynamically provisioned by the Kubernetes with Longhorn StorageClass.
* The field `allowVolumeExpansion` should be `true` in the related StorageClass.

This method is recommended if it's applicable, because the PVC and PV will be updated automatically and everything is kept consistent after expansion.

Usage: Find the corresponding PVC for Longhorn volume, then modify the requested `spec.resources.requests.storage` of the PVC:

==== Via Longhorn UI

Usage: On the volume page of Longhorn UI, click `Expand` for the volume.

== Filesystem expansion

Longhorn will try to expand the file system only if:

* The expanded size should be greater than the current size.
* There is a Linux filesystem in the Longhorn volume.
* The filesystem used in the Longhorn volume is one of the following:
 ** ext4
 ** xfs
* The expanded size must be less than the maximum file size allowed by the file system (for example, 16TiB for `ext4`).
* The Longhorn volume is using the block device frontend.

== Corner cases

==== Handling Volume Revert

If a volume is reverted to a snapshot with smaller size, the frontend of the volume is still holding the expanded size. But the filesystem size will be the same as that of the reverted snapshot. In this case, you will need to handle the filesystem manually:

. Attach the volume to a random node.
. Log in to the corresponding node, and expand the filesystem.
+
If the filesystem is `ext4`, the volume might need to be https://linux.die.net/man/8/mount[mounted] and https://linux.die.net/man/8/umount[umounted] once before resizing the filesystem manually. Otherwise, executing `resize2fs` might result in an error:
+
----
 resize2fs: Superblock checksum does not match superblock while trying to open ......
 Couldn't find valid filesystem superblock.
----
+
Follow the steps below to resize the filesystem:
+
----
 mount /dev/longhorn/<volume name> <arbitrary mount directory>
 umount /dev/longhorn/<volume name>
 mount /dev/longhorn/<volume name> <arbitrary mount directory>
 resize2fs /dev/longhorn/<volume name>
 umount /dev/longhorn/<volume name>
----

. If the filesystem is `xfs`, you can directly mount, then expand the filesystem.
+
----
 mount /dev/longhorn/<volume name> <arbitrary mount directory>
 xfs_growfs <the mount directory>
 umount /dev/longhorn/<volume name>
----

==== Encrypted volume

Longhorn support for online expansion depends on Kubernetes.

* Kubernetes natively supports https://kubernetes.io/blog/2023/12/15/csi-node-expand-secret-support-ga/[authenticated CSI storage resizing] starting in v1.29.
* In https://kubernetes.io/blog/2022/09/21/kubernetes-1-25-use-secrets-while-expanding-csi-volumes-on-node-alpha/[Kubernetes v1.25 to v1.28], the feature gate `CSINodeExpandSecret` is required.

You can enable online expansion for encrypted volumes by specifying the following xref:volumes/volume-encryption.adoc#_setting_up_kubernetes_secrets_and_storageclasses[encryption parameters in the StorageClass]:

* `csi.storage.k8s.io/node-expand-secret-name`
* `csi.storage.k8s.io/node-expand-secret-namespace`

If you cannot enable it but still prefer to do online expansion, you can:

. Login the node host the encrypted volume is attached to.
. Execute `cryptsetup resize <volume name>`. The passphrase this command requires is the field `CRYPTO_KEY_VALUE` of the corresponding secret.
. Expand the filesystem.

==== RWX volume

Starting with v1.8.0, Longhorn supports fully automatic online expansion of the filesystem (NFS) for RWX volumes. This feature requires that the v1.8.0 versions of the following components are running:

- Longhorn Manager
- CSI plugin
- Share Manager (manages the NFS export)

[NOTE]
====
During upgrades, the Share Manager pods (one for each RWX volume) are not upgraded automatically to avoid disruptions.
====

After growing the block device, the CSI layer sends a resize command to the Share Manager to grow the filesystem within the block device.  With a down-rev share-manager, the command fails with an "unimplemented" error code and so no expansion happens. To obtain the right image before the expansion, force a restart of the pod. Identify the Share Manager pod of the RWX volume (typically named `share-manager-<volume name>`) and delete it.

[,shell]
----
kubectl -n longhorn-system delete pod <the share manager pod>
----

The pod is automatically recreated using the appropriate version, and the expansion is completed. Further expansions will not require any further intervention.

[discrete]
===== Offline

Perform the following steps to allow expansion of RWX volumes while offline.

. Detach the RWX volume by scaling down the workload to `replicas=0`. Ensure that the volume is fully detached.
. After the scale command returns, run the following command and verify that the state is `detached`.
+
[subs="+attributes",shell]
----
 kubectl -n longhorn-system get volume <volume-name>
----

. Expand the block device using either the PVC or the Longhorn UI.
. Scale up the workload.

The reattached volume will have the expanded size. Furthermore, the Share Manager pod will be recreated with the current version.
