https://rancher.com/docs/k3s/latest/en/[K3s] is a fully compliant Kubernetes distribution that is easy to install, using half the memory, all in a binary of less than 50mb.

== Requirements

* {longhorn-product-name} v0.7.0 or later.
* `open-iscsi` or `iscsiadm` installed on the node.

== Instruction

{longhorn-product-name} supports only K3s v0.10.0 and later versions by default.

If you want to deploy {longhorn-product-name} on K3s versions earlier than v0.10.0, you need to set `--kubelet-root-dir` to `<data-dir>/agent/kubelet` for the Deployment `longhorn-driver-deployer` in `longhorn/deploy/longhorn.yaml`.

`data-dir` is a `k3s` arg and it can be set when you launch a k3s server. By default it is `/var/lib/rancher/k3s`.

== Troubleshooting

=== Failed to get arg root-dir: Cannot get kubelet root dir, no related proc for root-dir detection ...

This error is due to {longhorn-product-name} cannot detect where is the root dir setup for Kubelet, so the CSI plugin installation failed.

You can override the root-dir detection by setting environment variable `KUBELET_ROOT_DIR` in https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/blob/v{patch-version}/deploy/longhorn.yaml[`longhorn.yaml`]. 

=== How to find `root-dir`?

*For K3S prior to v0.10.0*

Run `ps aux | grep k3s` and get argument `--data-dir` or `-d` on k3s node.

e.g.

 $ ps uax | grep k3s
 root      4160  0.0  0.0  51420  3948 pts/0    S+   00:55   0:00 sudo /usr/local/bin/k3s server --data-dir /opt/test/kubelet
 root      4161 49.0  4.0 259204 164292 pts/0   Sl+  00:55   0:04 /usr/local/bin/k3s server --data-dir /opt/test/kubelet

You will find `data-dir` in the cmdline of proc `k3s`. By default it is not set and `/var/lib/rancher/k3s` will be used. Then joining `data-dir` with `/agent/kubelet` you will get the `root-dir`. So the default `root-dir` for K3S is `/var/lib/rancher/k3s/agent/kubelet`.

If K3S is using a configuration file, you would need to check the configuration file to locate the `data-dir` parameter.

*For K3S v0.10.0+*

It is always `/var/lib/kubelet`

== Background

=== {longhorn-product-name} versions earlier than v0.7.0 don't work on K3s v0.10.0 or later

K3s now sets its kubelet directory to `/var/lib/kubelet`. See https://github.com/rancher/k3s/releases/tag/v0.10.0[the K3S release comment] for details.
