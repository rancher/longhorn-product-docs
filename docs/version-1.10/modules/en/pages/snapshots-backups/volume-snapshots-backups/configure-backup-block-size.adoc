== Backup Blocks In {longhorn-product-name}

A {longhorn-product-name} backup is made up of data fragments from a snapshot, and each of these fragments is called a block. These blocks are the fundamental units for processing, transmitting, and storing data in the backup target. Every block within a single backup has the same physical size.

Before {longhorn-product-name} v1.10.0, the backup block size was fixed at 2 MiB. With {longhorn-product-name} v1.10.0 and later, users can set the backup block size when they create a new volume. This value is permanent and cannot be changed after the volume is created. The block size used for a specific volume is shown on its detail page in the {longhorn-product-name} UI, and all future backups for that volume will use that same size.

=== Impact of Backup Block Size

{longhorn-product-name} offers two backup block sizes: *2 MiB* and *16 MiB*. The size you choose affects how efficiently backups are created and stored.

. Larger block sizes mean fewer total blocks. This improves transmission efficiency and reduces the number of API requests sent to the backup target, which can speed up the backup process.
. However, larger block sizes can also use more physical storage space because of zero-padding and require more memory during the backup creation process.

== Global Default Backup Block Size

{longhorn-product-name} provides a global setting to define the default backup block size for new volumes. If you do not explicitly specify a backup block size when creating a volume, {longhorn-product-name} will use this default value.

You can change the default backup block size using either the {longhorn-product-name} UI or kubectl:

. Using the {longhorn-product-name} UI:
+
----
Settings > General > Default Backup Block Size
----

. Using `kubectl`:
+
[,bash]
----
kubectl -n longhorn-system edit settings.longhorn.io default-backup-block-size
----

== Create a Volume and Specify the Backup Block Size

To set a custom backup block size when creating a new volume, follow these steps:

. Go to the *Volume* menu.
. Select *Create Volume*.
. In the creation dialog, inside `Advanced Configurations`, choose your desired *Backup Block Size*.

== Specify the Backup Block Size in the Storage Class

For volumes created using a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC), you can specify the `backupBlockSize` within the `parameters` section of the `StorageClass`.

Example:

[,yaml]
----
kind: StorageClass
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: longhorn-example
provisioner: driver.longhorn.io
parameters:
  backupBlockSize: 16Mi
...
----

== Restoring a Volume From a Backup

When you restore a volume from a backup, you can set the new volume to a different backup block size than the original one.

[CAUTION]
====
{longhorn-product-name} versions older than v1.10 are not forward-compatible. They cannot restore backups made with {longhorn-product-name} v1.10 or newer. Attempting to restore a backup with a non-default block size (anything other than 2 MiB) on {longhorn-product-name} v1.9.x or earlier will create a volume with file system corruption.
