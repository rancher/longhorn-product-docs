Starting with v1.9.0, {longhorn-product-name} supports the UBLK front-end for V2 Data Engine Volumes.
This feature exposes V2 Data Engine volumes as a block device using the https://spdk.io/doc/ublk.html[UBLK SPDK framework].
In certain high-specification environments (for example, machines with fast SSDs capable of millions of IOPS and equipped with 32 CPU cores), the UBLK front-end might offer better performance compared to the default NVMe-oF front-end for V2 Data Engine volumes.
For performance comparisons, see the link:https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/wiki/Longhorn-Performance-Investigation[{longhorn-product-name} Performance Investigation wiki page].
However, the UBLK front-end is less mature than the default NVMe-oF front-end (see xref:_known_limitations[Known Limitations]).
The UBLK front-end also has additional restrictions, as detailed below.

== Prerequisites

. The kernel version on nodes must be v6.0 or later. The UBLK kernel driver is available only from kernel v6.0 onwards.
. The kernel module `ublk_drv` must be loaded on each node where UBLK volumes are to be attached. For testing, you can load it manually on each relevant node using the command:
+
[,bash]
----
modprobe ublk_drv
----

== How to use

=== When creating a V2 volume from the UI
Select `UBLK` as the volume front-end during volume creation.

=== When creating a V2 volume from a manifest
. Create a `StorageClass` that specifies the UBLK front-end. For example:
+
[,yaml]
----
kind: StorageClass
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: my-ublk-frontend-storageclass
provisioner: driver.longhorn.io
allowVolumeExpansion: true
reclaimPolicy: Delete
volumeBindingMode: Immediate
parameters:
  numberOfReplicas: "1"
  staleReplicaTimeout: "2880"
  fsType: "ext4"
  dataEngine: "v2"
  frontend: "ublk"
----
. Create a `PersistentVolumeClaim` (PVC) that references the `StorageClass` created in the previous step. For example:
+
[,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: my-ublk-frontend-pvc
  namespace: default
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  storageClassName: my-ublk-frontend-storageclass
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
----
. {longhorn-product-name} automatically provisions a V2 volume using the UBLK front-end based on the PVC and `StorageClass` definitions.

== Known Limitations
When an instance-manager pod crashes, it might leave orphaned UBLK devices on the node.
Currently, removing these orphaned devices manually can be difficult and might sometimes require a node reboot.
We are investigating this issue further in link:https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/10738[GitHub Issue #10738].
