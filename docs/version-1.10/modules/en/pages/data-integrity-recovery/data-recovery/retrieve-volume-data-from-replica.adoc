Each replica of a Longhorn volume contains the full data for the volume.

If the whole Kubernetes cluster or Longhorn system goes offline, the following steps can be used to retrieve the data of the volume.

. Identify the volume.
+
Longhorn uses the disks on the node to store the replica data.
+
By default, the data is stored at the directory specified by the setting xref:longhorn-system/settings.adoc#_default_data_path[`Default Data Path`].
+
More disks can be added to a node by either using the Longhorn UI or by using xref:nodes/default-disk-and-node-config.adoc[a node label and annotation].
+
You can either keep a copy of the path of those disks, or use the following command to find the disks that have been used by Longhorn. For example:
+
----
 # find / -name longhorn-disk.cfg
 /var/lib/longhorn/longhorn-disk.cfg
----
+
The result above shows that the path `/var/lib/longhorn` has been used by Longhorn to store data.

. Check the path found in step 1 to see if it contains the data.
+
The data will be stored in the `/replicas` directory, for example:
+
----
 # ls /var/lib/longhorn/replicas/
 pvc-06b4a8a8-b51d-42c6-a8cc-d8c8d6bc65bc-d890efb2
 pvc-71a266e0-5db5-44e5-a2a3-e5471b007cc9-fe160a2c
----
+
The directory naming pattern is:
+
----
 <volume_name>-<8 bytes UUID>
----
+
So in the example above, there are two volumes stored here, which are `pvc-06b4a8a8-b51d-42c6-a8cc-d8c8d6bc65bc` and `pvc-71a266e0-5db5-44e5-a2a3-e5471b007cc9`.
+
The volume name matches the Kubernetes PV name.

. Use the `lsof` command to make sure no one is currently using the volume, e.g.
+
----
# lsof pvc-06b4a8a8-b51d-42c6-a8cc-d8c8d6bc65bc-d890efb2/
COMMAND    PID USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE/OFF   NODE NAME
longhorn 14464 root  cwd    DIR    8,0     4096 541456 pvc-06b4a8a8-b51d-42c6-a8cc-d8c8d6bc65bc-d890efb2
----
+
The above result shows that the data directory is still being used, so don't proceed to the next step. If it's not being used, `lsof` command should return empty result.

. Check the volume size of the volume you want to restore using the following command inside the directory:
+
----
# cat pvc-06b4a8a8-b51d-42c6-a8cc-d8c8d6bc65bc-d890efb2/volume.meta
 {"Size":1073741824,"Head":"volume-head-000.img","Dirty":true,"Rebuilding":false,"Parent":"","SectorSize":512,"BackingFileName":""}
----
+
From the result above, you can see the volume size is `1073741824` (1 GiB). Note the size.

. To export the content of the volume, follow the instructions below that correspond to your environment.
* *Docker (RKE1)*
+
To export the content of the volume in a Docker environment, use the following command to create a single-replica Longhorn volume container:
+
----
docker run -v /dev:/host/dev -v /proc:/host/proc -v <data_path>:/volume --privileged longhornio/longhorn-engine:v{patch-version} launch-simple-longhorn <volume_name> <volume_size>
----
+
For example, based on the information above, the command should be:
+
----
docker run -v /dev:/host/dev -v /proc:/host/proc -v /var/lib/longhorn/replicas/pvc-06b4a8a8-b51d-42c6-a8cc-d8c8d6bc65bc-d890efb2:/volume --privileged longhornio/longhorn-engine:v{patch-version} launch-simple-longhorn pvc-06b4a8a8-b51d-42c6-a8cc-d8c8d6bc65bc 1073741824
----
* *Containerd (RKE2/K3s)*
+
To export the content of the volume in RKE2 or K3s environments, you need to create a static pod manifest. This manifest launches the Longhorn engine and exposes the volume.
+
Create a file named `longhorn-recovery.yaml` in the `/var/lib/rancher/rke2/agent/pod-manifests/` directory with the following content:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: longhorn-recovery
  namespace: longhorn-system
spec:
  hostPID: true
  containers:
  - name: engine
    image: longhornio/longhorn-engine:v<current-version>
    securityContext:
      privileged: true
    command: ["launch-simple-longhorn"]
    args: ["<volume-name>", "<volume-size-in-bytes>"]
    volumeMounts:
    - name: dev
      mountPath: /host/dev
    - name: proc
      mountPath: /host/proc
    - name: data
      mountPath: /volume
  volumes:
  - name: dev
    hostPath:
      path: /dev
  - name: proc
    hostPath:
      path: /proc
  - name: data
    hostPath:
      path: <host-path-to-replica>
  restartPolicy: Never
----
+
Replace the following placeholders in the manifest:
+
* `<current-version>`: The version of {longhorn-product-name} that you are using.
* `<volume-name>`: The name of the volume that you want to recover.
* `<host-path-to-replica>`: The path to the replica directory that you found in Step 1.
* `<volume-size-in-bytes>`: The size of the volume in bytes.
+
*Result:* Now you should have a block device created on `/dev/longhorn/<volume_name>` for this device, such as `/dev/longhorn/pvc-06b4a8a8-b51d-42c6-a8cc-d8c8d6bc65bc` for the example above. Now you can mount the block device to get the access to the data.

____
To avoid accidental change of the volume content, it's recommended to use `mount -o ro` to mount the directory as `readonly`.
____

After you are done accessing the volume content, use `docker stop` to stop the container. For RKE2, clean up the resources by removing the static pod manifest file `sudo rm /var/lib/rancher/rke2/agent/pod-manifests/longhorn-recovery.yaml`.
