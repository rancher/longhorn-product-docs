{longhorn-product-name} supports orphaned data cleanup. Currently, {longhorn-product-name} can identify and clean up the orphaned replica directories on disks.

== Orphaned Replica Directories

When a user introduces a disk into a {longhorn-product-name} node, it may contain replica directories that are not tracked by the {longhorn-product-name} system. The untracked replica directories may belong to other {longhorn-product-name} clusters. Or, the replica CRs associated with the replica directories are removed after the node or the disk is down. When the node or the disk comes back, the corresponding replica data directories are no longer tracked by the {longhorn-product-name} system. These replica data directories are called orphaned.

{longhorn-product-name} supports the detection and cleanup of orphaned replica directories. It identifies the directories and gives a list of `orphan` resources that describe those directories. By default, {longhorn-product-name} does not automatically delete `orphan` resources and their directories. Users can trigger the deletion of orphaned replica directories manually or have it done automatically.

When automatic orphan deletion is enabled, {longhorn-product-name} automatically deletes orphaned Custom Resources (CRs) and their associated directories after the delay defined by the `orphan-resource-auto-deletion-grace-period` setting. If a user manually deletes an orphaned CR, the deletion occurs immediately and does not respect this grace period.

=== Example

The following example demonstrate how to manage orphaned replica directories identified by {longhorn-product-name} via `kubectl` and {longhorn-product-name} UI.

==== Manage Orphaned Replica Directories via kubectl

==== Manage Orphaned Replica Directories via {longhorn-product-name} UI

. In the top navigation bar, select *Setting > Orphaned Data > Replica Data*.
. Review the displayed list of orphaned replica directories. These are grouped by node and disk.
. For the directory that you want to delete, select *Operation > Delete*.

By default, {longhorn-product-name} does not automatically delete orphaned replica directories. To enable automatic deletion, navigate to *Settings > Orphan* and configure the relevant option for automatic deletion.

=== Exception

{longhorn-product-name} will not create an `orphan` resource for an orphaned directory when

* The orphaned directory is not an *orphaned replica directory*.
 ** The directory name does not follow the replica directory's naming convention.
 ** The volume volume.meta file is missing.
* The orphaned replica directory is on an evicted node.
* The orphaned replica directory is in an evicted disk.
* The orphaned data cleanup mechanism does not clean up a stale replica, also known as an error replica. Instead, the stale replica is cleaned up according to the xref:volumes/create-volumes.adoc#_creating_longhorn_volumes_with_kubectl[staleReplicaTimeout] setting.
