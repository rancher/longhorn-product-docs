In Longhorn, set `replica-replenishment-wait-interval` to `0`.

See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/update-cluster.html[Updating a cluster] for instructions.

NOTE: If you have created xref:nodes/managed-kubernetes/eks-managed-node-pools.adoc#_create_additional_volume[addition disks] for Longhorn, you will need to manually add the path of the mounted disk into the disk list of the upgraded nodes.
