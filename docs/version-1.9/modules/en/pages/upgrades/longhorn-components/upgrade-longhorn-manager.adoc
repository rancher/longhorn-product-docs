= Upgrade Longhorn Manager
:current-version: {page-component-version}

[WARNING]
====
It is recommended to create a xref:snapshots-backups/system-backups/create-system-backup.adoc[Longhorn system backup] before performing the upgrade. This ensures that all critical resources, such as volumes and backing images, are backed up and can be restored in case any issues arise.
====

== Upgrading from v1.8.x

{longhorn-product-name} only supports upgrading to v{current-version} from v1.8.x. For other versions, please upgrade to v1.8.x first.

For airgap upgrades when {longhorn-product-name} is installed as a Rancher app, you will need to modify the image names and remove the registry URL part.

For airgap upgrades when Longhorn is installed as a Rancher app, you will need to modify the image names and remove the registry URL part.

For example, the image `registry.example.com/longhorn/longhorn-manager:v{patch-version}` is changed to `longhorn/longhorn-manager:v{patch-version}` in Longhorn images section (you can replace v{patch-version} with your desired {longhorn-product-name} version). For more information, see the air gap installation steps xref:installation-setup/installation/airgapped-environment.adoc#_using_a_rancher_app[here].

=== Preparing for the Upgrade

If {longhorn-product-name} was installed using a Helm Chart, or if it was installed as Rancher catalog app, check to make sure the parameters in the default StorageClass were not changed. Changing the parameter of the default StorageClass might result in a chart upgrade failure. If you want to reconfigure the parameters in the StorageClass, you can copy the configuration of default StorageClass to create another StorageClass.

The current default StorageClass has the following parameters:

[,yaml]
----
parameters:
  numberOfReplicas: <user specified replica count, 3 by default>
  staleReplicaTimeout: "30"
  fromBackup: ""
  baseImage: ""
----

== Upgrade

[IMPORTANT]
====
Always back up volumes before upgrading. If anything goes wrong, you can restore the volume using the backup.
====

=== Upgrade as a Rancher Catalog App

To upgrade the {longhorn-product-name} App, make sure which Rancher UI the existing {longhorn-product-name} App was installed with. There are two Rancher UIs, one is the Cluster Manager (old UI), and the other one is the Cluster Explorer (new UI). The {longhorn-product-name} App in different UIs considered as two different applications by Rancher. They cannot upgrade to each other. If you installed {longhorn-product-name} in the Cluster Manager, you need to use the Cluster Manager to upgrade {longhorn-product-name} to a newer version, and vice versa for the Cluster Explorer.

[NOTE]
====
Because the Cluster Manager (old UI) is being deprecated, the instruction to migrate the existing {longhorn-product-name} installation to the {longhorn-product-name} chart in the Cluster Explorer (new UI) can be found https://longhorn.io/kb/how-to-migrate-longhorn-chart-installed-in-old-rancher-ui-to-the-chart-in-new-rancher-ui/[here].

On Kubernetes clusters managed by Rancher 2.1 or newer, the steps to upgrade the catalog app `longhorn-system` are the similar to the installation steps.

=== Upgrade with Kubectl

To upgrade with kubectl, run this command:

----
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/longhorn/longhorn/v{patch-version}/deploy/longhorn.yaml
----

=======

=== Upgrade with Helm

Upgrading the {longhorn-product-name} Helm chart involves updating your deployment to a newer version or switching between Longhorn community images and {longhorn-product-name} images.

The general Helm command for upgrading is:

[,shell]
----
<<<<<<< HEAD
helm upgrade longhorn longhorn/longhorn --namespace longhorn-system --version {patch-version}
----

Upgrade with Helm Controller

Update the value of `spec.version` in the `HelmChart` YAML file:

[,yaml]
----
spec:
  version: v{patch-version} # Replace with the version you would like to upgrade to
  chart: longhorn
  repo: https://charts.longhorn.io
  failurePolicy: abort
----

Alternatively, if using the `spec.chartContent` key, create a patch file with

[,yaml]
----
spec:
  chartContent: <base64 content> # tar cz of longhorn charts directory for release | base64 -w 0
----

and then apply it with

----
kubectl  patch helmchart longhorn -n <namespace> --type merge --patch-file <name of patch file>
----

[IMPORTANT]
=======
helm upgrade longhorn oci://dp.apps.rancher.io/charts/suse-storage \
  --namespace longhorn-system \
  --version <version> \ # Replace with the version you would like to upgrade to
  --set global.imagePullSecrets=<PULL_IMAGE_SECRET> \
  -f values.yaml
----

[NOTE]
>>>>>>> e028cd2 (updates installation, updation, migration docs)
====
To create a secret, follow the https://docs.apps.rancher.io/get-started/authentication/#kubernetes[AppCo documentation].
====

Or, if upgrading without a specific `values.yaml` file and only changing the version:

[,shell]
----
helm upgrade longhorn oci://dp.apps.rancher.io/charts/suse-storage \
  --namespace longhorn-system \
  --version <version> \ # Replace with the version you would like to upgrade to
  --set global.imagePullSecrets=<PULL_IMAGE_SECRET>
----

* *Upgrade Path*: Refer to the official xref:upgrades/upgrades.adoc[SUSE Storage upgrade documentation] for specific version-to-version upgrade paths, prerequisites, and post-upgrade verification steps. This is important to ensure a smooth upgrade and data integrity.
* *Configuration Changes*: If you have custom configurations, ensure you carry them over to the new chart version, merging with any default changes.

=== Upgrade with Fleet

Update the value of `helm.version` in the `fleet` YAML file of your GitOps repository.

[,yaml]
----
helm:
  repo: https://charts.longhorn.io
  chart: longhorn
<<<<<<< HEAD
  version: v{patch-version} # Replace with the version you would like to upgrade to
=======
  version: v{patch-version} # Replace with the SUSE Storage version you would like to upgrade to
>>>>>>> e028cd2 (updates installation, updation, migration docs)
  releaseName: longhorn
----

=== Upgrade with Flux

Update the value of `spec.chart.spec.version` in the `HelmRelease` YAML file of your GitOps repository.

[,yaml]
----
spec:
  chart:
    spec:
      chart: longhorn
      reconcileStrategy: ChartVersion
      sourceRef:
        kind: HelmRepository
        name: longhorn
<<<<<<< HEAD
      version: v{patch-version} # Replace with the version you would like to upgrade to
=======
      version: v{patch-version} # Replace with the SUSE Storage version you would like to upgrade to
>>>>>>> e028cd2 (updates installation, updation, migration docs)
----

=== Upgrade with Argo CD

Update the value of `targetRevision` in the `Application` YAML file of your GitOps repository.

[,yaml]
----
spec:
  project: default
  sources:
    - chart: longhorn
      repoURL: https://charts.longhorn.io
<<<<<<< HEAD
      targetRevision: v{patch-version} # Replace with the version you would like to upgrade to
=======
      targetRevision: v{patch-version} # Replace with the SUSE Storage version you would like to upgrade to
>>>>>>> e028cd2 (updates installation, updation, migration docs)
----

Then wait for all the pods to become running and {longhorn-product-name} UI working. For example:

[,shell]
----

== Upgrading from Unsupported Versions

{longhorn-product-name} only supports upgrading to v{current-version} from v1.8.x. For other versions, please upgrade to v1.8.x first.

If you attempt to upgrade from an unsupported version, the upgrade will fail. When encountering an upgrade failure, please consider the following scenarios to recover the state based on different upgrade methods.

=== Upgrade with Kubectl

When you upgrade with kubectl by running this command:

[subs="+attributes",shell]
----
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/longhorn/longhorn/v{patch-version}/deploy/longhorn.yaml
----

Longhorn will block the upgrade process and provide the failure reason in the logs of the `longhorn-manager` pod.
During the upgrade failure, the user's Longhorn system should remain intact without any impacts except `longhorn-manager` daemon set.

To recover, you need to apply the manifest of the previously installed version using the following command:

[subs="+attributes",shell]
----
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/longhorn/longhorn/[previous installed version]/deploy/longhorn.yaml
----

Besides, users might need to delete new components introduced by the new version manually.

=== Upgrade with Helm or Rancher App Marketplace

To prevent any impact caused by failed upgrades from unsupported versions, Longhorn will automatically initiate a new job (`pre-upgrade`) to verify if the upgrade path is supported before upgrading when upgrading through `Helm` or `Rancher App Marketplace`.

The `pre-upgrade` job blocks the upgrade process and provides the cause of the failure in the pod logs.

Example:

----
2m33s     Normal      Created                   Pod/longhorn-pre-upgrade-v5tqq     Created container longhorn-pre-upgrade
2m33s     Warning     FailedUpgradePreCheck     /longhorn-pre-upgrade              failed to upgrade since upgrading from v1.6.2 to v1.8.0 for minor version is not supported
----

During upgrade failure, the Longhorn system should remain intact without any impact.

To recover, run the following commands to roll back to the previously installed revision:

[subs="+attributes",shell]
----
# get previous installed Longhorn REVISION
helm history longhorn
helm rollback longhorn [REVISION]

# or
helm upgrade longhorn longhorn/longhorn --namespace longhorn-system --version [previous installed version]
----

To recover, you need to upgrade to the previously installed revision at `Rancher App Marketplace` again.

== TroubleShooting

. Error: `"longhorn" is invalid: provisioner: Forbidden: updates to provisioner are forbidden.`
 ** This means there are some modifications applied to the default storageClass and you need to clean up the old one before upgrade.

* To clean up the deprecated StorageClass, run this command:
+
----
  kubectl delete -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/longhorn/longhorn/v{patch-version}/examples/storageclass.yaml
