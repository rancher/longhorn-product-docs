= Uninstallation

== Prerequisite

To prevent {longhorn-product-name} from being accidentally uninstalled (which leads to data lost), there is a new setting, xref:longhorn-system/settings.adoc#_deleting_confirmation_flag[deleting-confirmation-flag]. If this flag is `false`, the uninstallation job will fail. Set this flag to `true` to allow uninstallation. You can set this flag using setting page in the {longhorn-product-name} UI or `kubectl -n longhorn-system patch -p '{"value": "true"}' --type=merge lhs deleting-confirmation-flag`.

To prevent damage to the Kubernetes cluster, it is recommended to delete all Kubernetes workloads using {longhorn-product-name} volumes (PersistentVolume, PersistentVolumeClaim, StorageClass, Deployment, StatefulSet, DaemonSet, etc).

== Completely Remove {longhorn-product-name}

To completely remove the {longhorn-product-name} deployment from your Kubernetes cluster, use the `helm uninstall` command.

[,shell]
----
helm uninstall longhorn --namespace longhorn-system
----

== Uninstalling {longhorn-product-name} from the Rancher UI

From Rancher UI, navigate to `Catalog Apps` tab and delete the {longhorn-product-name} app.

== Uninstalling {longhorn-product-name} using Helm

Run the following command:

[,shell]
----
helm uninstall longhorn -n longhorn-system
----

== Uninstalling {longhorn-product-name} Using Helm Controller

Run the following command:

[,shell]
----
kubectl delete helmchart <HelmChart name> -n <HelmChart namespace>
----

== Uninstalling {longhorn-product-name} Using Helm Controller

Run the following command:

[,shell]
----
kubectl delete helmchart <HelmChart name> -n <HelmChart namespace>
----

== Uninstalling {longhorn-product-name} Using Fleet

Run the following command:

[,shell]
----
kubectl delete GitRepo longhorn -n fleet-local
----

After the `longhorn-uninstall` job is completed, run the following command:

[,shell]
----
kubectl delete -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/longhorn/longhorn/v{patch-version}/deploy/longhorn.yaml
----

== Uninstalling {longhorn-product-name} Using Flux

Run the following command:

[,shell]
----
flux delete helmrelease longhorn-release -n longhorn-system
----

== Uninstalling {longhorn-product-name} Using Argo CD

<<<<<<< HEAD
Argo CD currently does not support the PreDelete resource hook. Instead of running `argocd app delete longhorn` directly, you must <<Uninstalling {longhorn-product-name} using kubectl,uninstall {longhorn-product-name} using kubectl>> to prevent dangling resources from remaining in the `longhorn-system` namespace.

== Uninstalling {longhorn-product-name} using kubectl

. Create the uninstallation job to clean up CRDs from the system and wait for success:
+
----
 kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/longhorn/longhorn/v{patch-version}/uninstall/uninstall.yaml
 kubectl get job/longhorn-uninstall -n longhorn-system -w
----
+
Example output:
+
----
 $ kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/longhorn/longhorn/v{patch-version}/uninstall/uninstall.yaml
 serviceaccount/longhorn-uninstall-service-account created
 clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/longhorn-uninstall-role created
 clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/longhorn-uninstall-bind created
 job.batch/longhorn-uninstall created

 $ kubectl get job/longhorn-uninstall -n longhorn-system -w
 NAME                 COMPLETIONS   DURATION   AGE
 longhorn-uninstall   0/1           3s         3s
 longhorn-uninstall   1/1           20s        20s
----

. Remove remaining components:
+
----
 kubectl delete -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/longhorn/longhorn/v{patch-version}/deploy/longhorn.yaml
 kubectl delete -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/longhorn/longhorn/v{patch-version}/uninstall/uninstall.yaml
----

TIP: If you try `+kubectl delete -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/longhorn/longhorn/v{patch-version}/deploy/longhorn.yaml+` first and get stuck there,
pressing `Ctrl C` then running `+kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/longhorn/longhorn/v{patch-version}/uninstall/uninstall.yaml+` can also help you remove {longhorn-product-name}. Finally, don't forget to cleanup remaining components.

== Troubleshooting

=== Uninstalling using Rancher UI or Helm failed, I am not sure why

You might want to check the logs of the `longhorn-uninstall-xxx` pod inside `longhorn-system` namespace to see why it failed.
One reason can be that xref:longhorn-system/settings.adoc#_deleting_confirmation_flag[deleting-confirmation-flag] is `false`.
You can set it to `true` by using setting page in {longhorn-product-name} UI or `kubectl -n longhorn-system patch -p '{"value": "true"}' --type=merge lhs deleting-confirmation-flag`
then retry the Helm/Rancher uninstallation.

If the uninstallation was an accident, you can cancel the uninstallation as the following.

 .. Find the latest revision of {longhorn-product-name} release

=== I deleted the {longhorn-product-name} App from Rancher UI instead of following the uninstallation procedure

Redeploy the (same version) {longhorn-product-name} App. Follow the uninstallation procedure above.

=== Problems with CRDs

If your CRD instances or the CRDs themselves can't be deleted for whatever reason, run the commands below to clean up. Caution: this will wipe all {longhorn-product-name} state!

[,shell]
----
# Delete CRD finalizers, instances and definitions
for crd in $(kubectl get crd -o jsonpath={.items[*].metadata.name} | tr ' ' '\n' | grep longhorn.io); do
  kubectl -n ${NAMESPACE} get $crd -o yaml | sed "s/\- longhorn.io//g" | kubectl apply -f -
  kubectl -n ${NAMESPACE} delete $crd --all
  kubectl delete crd/$crd
done
----

If you encounter the following error, it is possible that an incomplete uninstallation removed the {longhorn-product-name} validation or modification webhook services, but left the same services registered.

`+for: "STDIN": error when patching "STDIN": Internal error occurred: failed calling webhook "validator.longhorn.io": failed to call webhook: Post "https://longhorn-admission-webhook.longhorn-system.svc:9502/v1/webhook/validation?timeout=10s": service "longhorn-admission-webhook" not found+`

You can run the following commands to check the status of the webhook services.

[subs="+attributes",shell]
----
$ kubectl get ValidatingWebhookConfiguration -A
NAME                               WEBHOOKS   AGE
longhorn-webhook-validator         1          46d
rancher.cattle.io                  7          133d
rke2-ingress-nginx-admission       1          133d
rke2-snapshot-validation-webhook   1          133d

$ kubectl get MutatingWebhookConfiguration -A
NAME                       WEBHOOKS   AGE
longhorn-webhook-mutator   1          46d
rancher.cattle.io          4          133d
----

If either or both are still registered, you can delete the configuration to remove the services from the patch operation call path.

[subs="+attributes",shell]
----
$ kubectl delete ValidatingWebhookConfiguration longhorn-webhook-validator
validatingwebhookconfiguration.admissionregistration.k8s.io "longhorn-webhook-validator" deleted

$ kubectl delete MutatingWebhookConfiguration longhorn-webhook-mutator
mutatingwebhookconfiguration.admissionregistration.k8s.io "longhorn-webhook-mutator" deleted
----

The script should run successfully after the configuration is deleted.

[subs="+attributes",shell]
